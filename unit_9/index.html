				<p id="main-body">I have always enjoyed being creative and have dabbled in photography and graphic design whenever I could find the chance as my hobbies for many years. I used to go and sit up on top of my apartment building for hours taking long exposures of lightning over the city, and then spend even more hours in the editing room! And I would always jump at the chance to design invitations for my friends weddings or birthday parties. Being able to express my creativity through these mediums brings me so much joy and I truly believe that my passion and really comes through in my designs and end products.</p>
